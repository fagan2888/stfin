# finlib
A simple library for collecting financial data from the web.

The functions implemented so far:
1. ``get_yahoo_quote``: Fetches price data for a symbol by querying finance.yahoo.
2. ``get_sp_500``: Fetches the list of companies included in the S&P500 index.

``demo.py`` demonstrates basic usage. Run it from the command line using ``python demo.py``.
